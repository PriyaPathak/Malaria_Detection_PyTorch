# Malaria_Detection_PyTorch
<h3>OBJECTIVE </b> </h3> Objective of this paper is to explore the use of Deep Learning Algorithms like ResNet, image classification to identify the infected/ parasitised blood cells.</h3>
<h5>As per the The World malaria report 2019 published in December 4,2019 bY WHO, in 2018, an estimated 228 million cases of malaria occurred worldwide, compared with 251 million cases in 2010 and 231 million cases in 2017. Plasmodium falciparum is the most prevalent malaria parasite in the WHO African Region, accounting for 99.7% of estimated malaria cases in 2018, as well as in the WHO South-East Asia Region (50%), the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (71%) and the WHO Western Pacific Region (65%). Globally, 53% of the P. vivax (a predominant parasite in the WHO Region of the Americas, representing 75% of malaria cases) burden is in the WHO South-East Asia Region, with the majority being in India (47%). 
  Features of the model:<br>
1.The deep learning model was created using PyTorch (PyTorch is a Python-based scientific computing package that uses the power of graphics processing units. It is also one of the preferred deep learning research platforms built to provide maximum flexibility and speed. It is known for providing two of the most high-level features; namely, tensor computations with strong GPU acceleration support and building deep neural networks on a tape-based autograd systems.<br>
2.Using PyTorch, a pretrained model, ResNet18 model was fetched.<br>
3.The model was trained using 24 epochs to achieve the validation accuracy of 96.22%.</h5>
